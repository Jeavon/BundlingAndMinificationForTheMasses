WRN: Partial binding information was supplied for an assembly:
WRN: Assembly Name: BundleTransformer.CoffeeScript | Domain ID: 2
WRN: A partial bind occurs when only part of the assembly display name is provided.
WRN: This might result in the binder loading an incorrect assembly.
WRN: It is recommended to provide a fully specified textual identity for the assembly,
WRN: that consists of the simple name, version, culture, and public key token.
